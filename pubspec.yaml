# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a

  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

flutter_native_splash:
  # This package generates native code to customize Flutter's default white native splash screen
  # with background color and splash image.
  # Customize the parameters below, and run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:create
  # To restore Flutter's default white splash screen, run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:remove

  # IMPORTANT NOTE: These parameter do not affect the configuration of Android 12 and later, which
  # handle splash screens differently that prior versions of Android.  Android 12 and later must be
  # configured specifically in the android_12 section below.

  # color or background_image is the only required parameter.  Use color to set the background
  # of your splash screen to a solid color.  Use background_image to set the background of your
  # splash screen to a png image.  This is useful for gradients. The image will be stretch to the
  # size of the app. Only one parameter can be used, color and background_image cannot both be set.
  color: "#ff0000"
  #background_image: "assets/images/prudapp_icon.png"

  # Optional parameters are listed below.  To enable a parameter, uncomment the line by removing
  # the leading # character.

  # The image parameter allows you to specify an image used in the splash screen.  It must be a
  # png file and should be sized for 4x pixel density.
  image: assets/images/icon_1152.png

  # The branding property allows you to specify an image used as branding in the splash screen.
  # It must be a png file. It is supported for Android, iOS and the Web.  For Android 12,
  # see the Android 12 section below.
  branding: assets/images/prudapp_logo_white.png

  # To position the branding image at the bottom of the screen you can use bottom, bottomRight,
  # and bottomLeft. The default values is bottom if not specified or specified something else.
  #branding_mode: bottom

  # Set the branding padding from the bottom of the screen.  The default value is 0
  # branding_bottom_padding: 24

  # The color_dark, background_image_dark, image_dark, branding_dark are parameters that set the background
  # and image when the device is in dark mode. If they are not specified, the app will use the
  # parameters from above. If the image_dark parameter is specified, color_dark or
  # background_image_dark must be specified.  color_dark and background_image_dark cannot both be
  # set.
  #color_dark: "#042a49"
  #background_image_dark: "assets/dark-background.png"
  #image_dark: assets/splash-invert.png
  #branding_dark: assets/dart_dark.png

  # From Android 12 onwards, the splash screen is handled differently than in previous versions.
  # Please visit https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/splash-screen
  # Following are specific parameters for Android 12+.
  android_12:
  # The image parameter sets the splash screen icon image.  If this parameter is not specified,
  # the app's launcher icon will be used instead.
  # Please note that the splash screen will be clipped to a circle on the center of the screen.
  # App icon with an icon background: This should be 960×960 pixels, and fit within a circle
  # 640 pixels in diameter.
  # App icon without an icon background: This should be 1152×1152 pixels, and fit within a circle
  # 768 pixels in diameter.
    image: assets/images/icon_1152.png

  # Splash screen background color.
    color: "#ff0000"

  # App icon background color.
    icon_background_color: "#ff0000"

  # The branding property allows you to specify an image used as branding in the splash screen.
    branding: assets/images/prudapp_logo_white.png

  # The image_dark, color_dark, icon_background_color_dark, and branding_dark set values that
  # apply when the device is in dark mode. If they are not specified, the app will use the
  # parameters from above.
    image_dark: assets/images/icon_1152.png
    color_dark: "#ff0000"

  # The position of the splash image can be set with android_gravity, ios_content_mode, and
  # web_image_mode parameters.  All default to center.
  #
  # android_gravity can be one of the following Android Gravity (see

  # fill_vertical, left, right, start, or top.
  #android_gravity: center
  #
  # ios_content_mode can be one of the following iOS UIView.ContentMode (see
  # https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/contentmode): scaleToFill,
  # scaleAspectFit, scaleAspectFill, center, top, bottom, left, right, topLeft, topRight,
  # bottomLeft, or bottomRight.
  #ios_content_mode: center
  #
  # web_image_mode can be one of the following modes: center, contain, stretch, and cover.
  #web_image_mode: center

  # Valid parameters can be found here:
  # https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#screen
  #android_screen_orientation: sensorLandscape

  # To hide the notification bar, use the fullscreen parameter.  Has no effect in web since web
  # has no notification bar.  Defaults to false.
  # NOTE: Unlike Android, iOS will not automatically show the notification bar when the app loads.
  #       To show the notification bar, add the following code to your Flutter app:
  #       WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  #       SystemChrome.setEnabledSystemUIMode(SystemUiMode.manual, overlays: [SystemUiOverlay.bottom, SystemUiOverlay.top], );
  #fullscreen: true

  # If you have changed the name(s) of your info.plist file(s), you can specify the filename(s)

  # do not remove any spaces:
  #info_plist_files:
  #  - 'ios/Runner/Info-Debug.plist'
